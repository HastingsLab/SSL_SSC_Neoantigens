## Parent tumors

**TO DO: Make directories for the QC and variant calling steps and copy over files from Parent_cell_lines directory that are relevant to these analyses, then update this section of the README**

**Description:** Analysis of whole exome sequencing data from histologically-verified cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cell lines generated with solar simulated light on BALB/C mice.

**Contents:**

/GATK_CNV 

* Calculates the copy number variation in the variants identified

/Run_fastclone_pipeline

* Steps used to assess heterogeneity of the tumor samples using the fastclone software

/Prep_mobster_input

* Steps used to assess heterogeneity of the tumor samples using the mobster software
